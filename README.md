# EE2026 Vivado Project
This is a project on Basys 3 FPGA Board, coded purely on Verilog language using Vivado, for National University of Singapore (NUS) "EE2026 DIgital Design" Module.

In this project, PMod Oled RGB 96x64 pixels and PMod MIC3 was used to interface with the Basys Board to create a "Sound and Sight Entertainment System".

Implemented features includes:
1. A basic volume testing system that takes in mic data and displays volume visually.
2. A two-player Pokemon shooting game.
3. A simple version of Fruit Ninja called Sliced, where the fruit when user frequency exceeds certain thershold.
4. An FPGA version of WaterSort or BallSort, named Potion Mixing.
5. Menu system for easy navigation between features.
